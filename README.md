# Mediaball
The game consists of drawing pre-recorded images in mp4 format and then inserting them into the media context using NCL tools. In this game screen, the penalty taker will approach the ball and the Mediaball player will have 3 seconds to press a button and decide which way the ball will go. At the end of the screens, a total of 10, the player will check his hits. The interesting thing about this game is that the media content can be easily manipulated following the middlware interactivity concept.
